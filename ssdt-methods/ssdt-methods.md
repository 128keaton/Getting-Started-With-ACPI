# How to create SSDTs

Creating SSDTs mainly fall into 3 camps:

* Prebuilt SSDTs
  * They work but not perfect
* Automated tools
  * Mainly seen with SSDTTime, work much better though can't cover all situations
* Manually creating them
  * Will always work, be much cleaner and get to learn about the process
